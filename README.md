> **LokaPay is a hybrid payment infrastructure that bridges the global crypto economy with the local real economy.**

LokaPay enables international tourists to pay using **Stablecoins** (USDT), while local merchants (SMEs) receive instant balance in **Rupiah (IDR)** without expensive credit card fees or physical money changers.

---

## 💡 The Problem & Solution

### The Problem (Pain Points)

- **Currency Friction:** Tourists must visit physical money changers with poor exchange rates
- **High Fees:** International credit cards charge 3-5% transaction fees
- **Merchant Gap:** Small businesses struggle to access global banking services
- **Complexity:** Traditional payment systems require extensive setup and infrastructure

### The LokaPay Solution

| Problem | Solution |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Currency Friction** | Instant conversion: Pay with your stablecoin USDT, system auto-converts to Rupiah |
| **High Fees** | Low cost: Leverage blockchain efficiency with minimal fees |
| **Merchant Gap** | Web2 Experience: Merchants don't need to understand crypto. Just scan QR like QRIS |
| **Complexity** | Simple Setup: Easy registration, instant settlement, no hardware required |

CHAIN_ID=5003
CHAIN_NETWORK=MANTLE
CHAIN_EXPLORER=https://explorer.sepolia.mantle.xyz

```

**`packages/database/.env`** (or root `.env`):
```env
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://lokapay_admin:lokapay_password@localhost:5433/lokapay_db?schema=public
```

### 2. Smart Contracts Deployment

Deploy smart contracts to the blockchain (Mantle Sepolia testnet):

```bash
cd packages/contracts

# Install dependencies
bun install

# Compile contracts
bun run compile

# Deploy contracts
bun run deploy --network MANTLE
```

After deployment, **save the contract addresses** to your `.env` files:
- `FACTORY_ADDRESS` → `apps/api/.env` and `apps/worker/.env`
- `USDT_ADDRESS` → `apps/api/.env`, `apps/worker/.env`, and `apps/web/.env.local`
- `COLD_WALLET_ADDRESS` → `apps/api/.env` and `apps/worker/.env`

**Verify contracts on block explorer:**
```bash
# Set contract addresses in packages/contracts/.env first
bunx hardhat run scripts/verify.ts --network MANTLE
```

For detailed contract documentation, verification instructions, and architecture, see [packages/contracts/README.md](./packages/contracts/README.md)

### 3. Database Setup

Start Docker and initialize the database:

```bash
# Start PostgreSQL and Redis containers
docker-compose up -d

# Generate Prisma client and push schema
cd packages/database
bun x prisma generate
bun run db:push

# Seed admin account (optional)
cd ../../apps/api
bun run db:seed
```

### 4. Run Development Servers

From the root directory:

```bash
bun dev
```

This will start:
- **Frontend:** `http://localhost:3000`
- **Backend API:** `http://localhost:3001`
- **Worker:** Background job processor (payment watcher & relayer)
- **Database:** PostgreSQL on port 5433
- **Redis:** Required for job queue (runs via Docker)

### 5. Access the Application

- **Merchant Login:** `http://localhost:3000/login`
- **Admin Login:** Use the seeded admin credentials
- **API Docs:** Available at `http://localhost:3001`

## 📚 API References

### Hooks

#### `useAuth`
Authentication state management hook using Zustand.

```typescript
import { useAuth } from '@/src/store/useAuth'

const { user, token, login, logout, fetchMerchantData, updateBalance } = useAuth()
```

**Methods:**
- `login(user: User, token: string)` - Login and store credentials
- `logout()` - Clear authentication state
- `fetchMerchantData()` - Fetch current merchant data
- `updateBalance(balanceIDR: string)` - Update merchant balance

### Services

#### `generateEIP681AddressURI`
Generate EIP-681 compliant payment URI for QR codes.

```typescript
import { generateEIP681AddressURI } from '@/src/constants/network'

const paymentURI = generateEIP681AddressURI(
  recipientAddress,
  amountUSDT,
  chainId
)
```

### Exchange Rate Service

LokaPay uses **IDRX API** to fetch real-time USDT/IDR exchange rates. The rate is fetched on-demand when creating new invoices to ensure accurate conversion.
The exchange rate is stored with each transaction to maintain historical accuracy and prevent rate fluctuations from affecting completed transactions.

## 🛠 Development

### Running Development Servers

```bash
# Run all services (database, API, web, worker)
bun dev

# Run only specific services
bun run dev:api      # API only
bun run dev:web      # Web only
bun run dev:worker   # Worker only
bun run dev:services # Database, API, and Web (no worker)
```

### Building for Production

```bash
# Build web application
cd apps/web
bun run build

# Start production server
bun run start
```

### Linting

```bash
# Lint web application
cd apps/web
bun run lint

# Lint with auto-fix
bun run lint --fix
```

### Database Migrations

```bash
cd packages/database

# Generate Prisma client
bun x prisma generate

# Push schema changes to database
bun run db:push

# Create migration
bun x prisma migrate dev --name migration_name

# Reset database (⚠️ WARNING: Deletes all data)
bun x prisma migrate reset
```

### Type Checking

```bash
# Check TypeScript types
bun run tsc --noEmit
```

### Worker Service

The worker service (`apps/worker`) is a background job processor that handles two critical tasks:

#### 1. Payment Watcher Job
Runs every **15 seconds** via cron to:
- **Monitor Transaction Status:** Scans all pending and partially paid transactions
- **Detect Payments:** Checks USDT balance on payment addresses using blockchain RPC
- **Update Status:** Automatically updates transaction status (PENDING → PARTIALLY_PAID → PAID → OVERPAID)
- **Credit Merchant Balance:** When payment is confirmed, credits merchant's IDR balance atomically
- **Trigger Sweeps:** Queues completed transactions for fund sweeping

**Key Features:**
- Atomic database transactions to prevent race conditions
- Automatic tip calculation for overpaid transactions
- Real-time balance monitoring without webhooks
- Handles partial payments gracefully

#### 2. Relayer Job
Processes jobs from a Redis queue to:
- **Deploy Vault Contracts:** Deploys CREATE2 deterministic vault contracts when needed
- **Sweep Funds:** Transfers USDT from payment vaults to the cold wallet
- **Gas Management:** Monitors relayer wallet balance and prevents operations if gas is insufficient
- **Error Handling:** Retries failed jobs automatically with proper error logging

**Queue System:**
- Uses **BullMQ** with **Redis** for job queue management
- Processes one job at a time (concurrency: 1) to prevent gas conflicts
- Automatic retry on failures
- Job cleanup after completion/failure

**Running the Worker:**

```bash
# Run worker separately
bun run dev:worker

# Or run with all services
bun dev
```

**Worker Requirements:**
- Redis server (runs via Docker Compose)
- Relayer wallet with sufficient gas
- Access to blockchain RPC endpoint
- Database connection
